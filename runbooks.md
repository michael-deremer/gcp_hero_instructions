## Google Cloud Billing Account Daily
### Whats its do, Why do we need it?
> Not sure yet
##### OOM
> Dragana noticed this first around mid october. It seems like some solvers require more than the ecs instances memory (6GB) and the oom happens.
> Its noteworthy that spot gets 8GB and periodic gets 6GB so its more likely to happen on periodic.
> So far this has only happened once in prod and the next run was ok. Keep an eye on this. We will have to address if it starts happening frequently.
